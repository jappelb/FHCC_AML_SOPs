                                <h1 id="fhcc-aml-standard-practice">FHCC AML Standard Practice</h1>
<p>AML treatment evolves constantly. This serves to document our latest consensus practice. Individual treatments will be a product of discussions between providers and patients. This site is not meant to substitute for clinical judgement, but rather outlines the considerations providers will make, and pulls data that maybe useful in deciding treatment of AML patients. By making these considerations explicit, treatment hopefully will be more uniform and consistent across providers.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-consideration">Topics of Consideration</h2>
<p>Several general topics should be considered prior to recommending initial therapy. A general approach to treatment should be methodical and assess the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the diagnosis (i.e. is it AML?)</li>
<li>Does this patient need urgent treatment? (See indications for urgent treatment.)</li>
<li>Is all of the information required for diagnosis, risk stratification, and response assessments available?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these initial answers are available, a more nuanced discussion of risk stratification, likelihood of tolerating various chemotherapy regimens, and overall treatment course can be conducted. ## Initial Workup</p>
<p>FHCC adopts the European Leukemia Net (ELN) approach to risk stratification with closely mirrors the world health organization international consensus classification of myeloid malignancies. ELN was recently updated <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/doi/10.1182/blood.2022016867/485817/Diagnosis-and-Management-of-AML-in-Adults-2022-ELN" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend patients have samples obtained capable of rendering an exact diagnosis with risk stratification.</p>
<h3 id="disease-characterization">Disease Characterization</h3>
<p>As of 2022, this required at least some genetic sequencing approaches in addition to karyotyping. If the circulating blast concentration exceeds 2000/uL, it is likely that sufficient information for genetic characterization as well as metaphase karyotypic could be obtained from the peripheral blood. If this is not the case a bone marrow aspirate should be obtained.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is based on blast percentage - patients with 10-20% blasts are classified as &quot;MDS/AML&quot; reflecting the continuum of clinical disease and the high risk of patients with &gt;10% blasts. These patients maybe enrolled on trials evaluating either MDS or AML-type therapy. Patients with &gt;20% blasts are characterized as &quot;AML&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="general-patient-characterization">General Patient Characterization</h3>
<ul>
<li>family history of malignancy</li>
<li>prior medical diagnosis <em>especially</em>: <ul>
<li>heart disease </li>
<li>lung disease</li>
<li>renal disease</li>
<li>hepatobiliary disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ECOG performance status (<strong>should be carefully scrutinized!</strong>)<ul>
<li>0 = No limitations, fully activty, capable of working <em>Note: patients with AML are rarely ECOG 0</em>.</li>
<li>1 = Slight limitations </li>
<li>2 = Incapable of more than light activity. Up and about &gt;50% of the day</li>
<li>3 = Capable of all self care, in a bed or chair &gt;50% of the day</li>
<li>4 = Assitance needed for self care</li>
<li>5 = Dead</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of first degree relatives should be documented - siblings, children, parents, and their vital status and general health should be noted, as a preliminary to consideration of future transplant. <em>The presence or absence of a caregiver is especially important to note.</em></p>
<p>Additional testing should include a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel.</p>
<h3 id="patient-fitness">Patient Fitness</h3>
<p>Patient fitness is a key determinant of treatment, as fit patients have a lower risk of early death following intensive treatment. Non-intensive treatment is rarely curative.</p>
<p>Fitness can be assessed by calculating the Walter &apos;Treatment Related Mortality Score&apos; (TRM) via an online calculator here: <a href="https://trmcalculator.fredhutch.org/" target="_blank">https://trmcalculator.fredhutch.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively an affirmative answer to any of the following questions suggests lack of fitness for intensive treatments:</p>
<ol>
<li>An age older than 75 years</li>
<li>Congestive heart failure or documented cardiomyopathy with an EF &#x2264;50%</li>
<li>Documented pulmonary disease with DLCO &#x2264;65% or FEV1 &#x2264;65%, or dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen, or any pleural neoplasm or uncontrolled lung neoplasm. <em>Note that in the absence of prior pulmonary function tests, patients without a documented history of lung disease will not meet this criterion.</em><ul>
<li>A useful question is &quot;are you able today to walk up a full flight of stairs unaided?&quot; An affirmative answer makes significant lung disease unlikely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On dialysis <em>and</em> age older than 60 years, or uncontrolled renal carcinoma</li>
<li>Liver cirrhosis Child B or C, or documented liver disease with marked elevation of transaminases (&gt;3 times normal values) and an age older than 60 years, or any biliary tree carcinoma or uncontrolled liver carcinoma or acute viral hepatitis</li>
<li>Active infection resistant to anti-infective therapy</li>
<li>Current mental illness requiring psychiatric hospitalization, institutionalization or intensive outpatient management, or current cognitive status that produces dependence (as confirmed by the specialist) not controlled by the caregiver</li>
<li>ECOG performance status &#x2265;3 not related to leukemia</li>
<li>Any other comorbidity that the physician judges to be incompatible with conventional intensive chemotherapy</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="clinical-trials">Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>In general, every effort should be made to enroll patients on an appropriate clinical trial if available.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that clinical trials should not be offered to patients unless patient participation is appropriate. Patient participation is only appropriate if (a) in the context of randomized trials, any arm to which the patient maybe randomized would be considered an optimal or appropriate treatment, or if (b) in the context of non-randomized trials, the treatment on the trial would be expected to be as good as any &apos;standard&apos; treatment the patient could receive in the context of usual (i.e. non-trial) care.</p>
<p>In all cases assessing whether clinical trial participation is appropriate requires shared decision making with the treating physician. The value of standard treatment depends on the expected risks and benefits. Use of intensive therapy as salvage among patients who relapse within 6 months after transplant is associated with poor response rates (~25%) and a median overall survival of only ~6 months. Whether this benefit is worth the toxicity should be the subject of a discussion between physicians and their patients.</p>
<p>In some cases, randomized trials have demonstrated that superior outcomes when compared to control treatments. Such findings do not preclude the ethical enrollment of a patient on a clinical trial. As an example, among patients with relapsed AML w/ FLT3-ITD mutations, targeted therapy with gilteritinib resulted in survival that was longer than with intensive chemotherapy; <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1902688" target="_blank">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1902688</a>. Nevertheless the median event-free survival of patients treated with gilteritinib was only 2.7 months. Some patients may decide that the magnitude of benefit from standard therapies (i.e. gilteritinib) was so small as to be inconsequential, and as a result that consideration of trial therapy is reasonable. While, as a result of these data, especially strong pre-clinical data may be needed to justify treating patients with relapsed AML w/ FLT3-ITD on a trial rather than with gilteritinib, such a patient may understandably consider the benefit of participating in clinical research and developing new knowledge as a balance to the uncertain efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach.</p>
